# oldillusion

## What's with the silly name?

No-one actually asks where oldillusion comes from, but I'll explain it any way.

It's a misheard lyric from the opening song, Rodent, on Skinny Puppy's Rabies album.  I was sure for years the line was "*an old illusion*", which I then thought would be a great name for their greatest hits - only to later find out it's "*and all illusion*".

Still think it would have been a good name for a greatest hits collection, but it's my name now.

## And the emo-kid with the knives for the logo?

It's not a phase, Mom!  That's Johnny the Homicidan Maniac, a brilliant comic by Jhonen Vasquez, who also created the equally brilliant cartoon, Invader Zim.

## You've been in IT for decades, why so little code here?

Because I'm an idiot and I have a bad habit of deleting things when I have no need for them any more.  This has caused me delete loads of repos over the years that I just didn't care for any more - sure, archiving would have been smarter, but here we are.

Won't be making that mistake again, so no matter how abandoned or rubbish future ideas will become, I'll just go with the archive solution.
