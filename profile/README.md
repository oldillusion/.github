## Why the name?

No-one asks, but I'll explain it any way.  It's a misheard lyric from the opening song, Rodent, on Skinny Puppy's Rabies album.  I was sure for years the line was "an old illusion", which I then thought would be a great name for their greatest hits - only to later find out it's "and all illusion".

Still think it would have been a good name for a greates hits collection, but it's my name now.
